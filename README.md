# VulkEngineGUI
An extension of the VulkEngine derived from Branden Galea's [youtube tutorial series](https://youtu.be/Y9U9IE0gVHA?si=FaguNnzkSW2KpxZJ) (probably for physics sims).

If you are trying to implement this, you should be able to setup a VS project or a cmake file with this code, that links to the Vulkan.h and GLFW libraries, as discussed [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/en/Development_environment). AKA -- first get the dev_environment setup, then copy paste this repo into the project.
